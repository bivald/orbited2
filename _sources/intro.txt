Overview
========

Orbited2's purpose is to ease the development of Websocket-based applications by normalizing the protocol and api across varying browser and server implementations. 


 #. Choose a WebSocket server framework/library (like node.js, or eventlet.)
 #. Write a WebSocket application.
 #. Deploy Orbited2. It will put a normalized Websocket API in *all* browsers.



The Problem
-----------

WebSocket is a far better real-time web protocol than anything we've seen so far, but it only works in a couple of the latest browsers. Additionally, the protocol is so new that it changes very quickly; a WebSocket application you write today might well stop working tomorrow. Further compounding the problem are the multitude of entrenched intermediaries, namely forward proxies, reverse proxies,  firewalls, virus scanners, and more -- these obstacles will intercept and deny WebSocket connections.

The Solution
------------

This code works in *all* browsers, and it will always use the best communication mechanism possible.

.. sourcecode:: html
    
    <script src="http://example.com:8000/static/Orbited2.js"></script>
    

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    Orbited2.WebSocket.install({
        protocolVersion: "hixie76",
    })

    var ws = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/app')


Orbited Veterans
----------------

For all of you Orbited veterans who aren't so sure about writing WebSocket servers, and you just want to keep using trusty old Orbited.TCPSocket (but with performance and usability improvments) -- don't worry!

.. sourcecode:: html

    <script src="Orbited2.js"></script>
    

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    var sock = new Orbited2.TCPSocket({ orbitedUri: "http://127.0.0.1:8000" })
    sock.open("irc.freenode.org", 6667);
    sock.onopen = function() { 
        sock.send('NICK mcarter\r\n');
    }
    //etc
